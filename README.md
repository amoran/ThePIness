# ThePIness

This project is the result of a competition with a Raspberry Pi.  The goal was to parse many formats and large volumes of data and present that information in a web interface.  The data was pizza orders, information, and customers.  We presented this information in a web service hosted by Nodejs.  

Nodejs constitutes the back end that served a RESTful API for information from the database.  

The front end was made with the help of Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery AJAX calls to the backend.  

The database was in MySQL.
